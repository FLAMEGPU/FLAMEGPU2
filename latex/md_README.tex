The project aim is to develop an existing computer application called F\+L\+A\+M\+E\+G\+PU, a high performance Graphics Processing Unit (G\+PU) extension to the F\+L\+A\+ME framework that provides a mapping between a formal agent specifications with C based scripting and optimised C\+U\+DA code to support scalable muti-\/agent simulation. The plan it to expand/extend features and capabilities of the exiting \href{https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU}{\tt F\+L\+A\+M\+E\+G\+PU software}, in order to position it as a middle-\/ware for complex systems simulation. The application is expected to be the equivalent of Thrust for simplifying complex systems on G\+P\+Us. The F\+L\+A\+M\+E\+G\+PU library includes algorithms such as spatial partitioning, network communication.

The Code is currently under active development and should {\bfseries not be used} until the first release.

\subsubsection*{Continuous Integration}

Continuous integration is provided by Travis (Linux) and windows (App\+Veyor). This performs only build tests and the virtual machines do not support executing the Boost unit tests. Each build has a script which is required to install the C\+U\+DA toolkit on the VM worker node. See the scripts folder for more details.
