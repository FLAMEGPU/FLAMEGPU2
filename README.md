### Introduction

The project aim is to develop an existing computer application called FLAMEGPU, a high performance Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) extension to the FLAME framework that provides a mapping between a formal agent specifications with C based scripting and optimised CUDA code to support scalable muti-agent simulation.  The plan it to expand/extend features and capabilities of the exiting <a href="https://github.com/FLAMEGPU/FLAMEGPU">FLAMEGPU software</a>, in order to position it as a middle-ware for complex systems simulation. The application is expected to be the equivalent of Thrust for simplifying complex systems on GPUs.  The FLAMEGPU library includes  algorithms such as spatial partitioning, network communication.

The Code is currently under active development and should **not be used** until the first release.

### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration is provided by Travis (Linux) and windows (AppVeyor). This performs only build tests and the virtual machines do not support executing the Boost unit tests. Each build has a script which is required to install the CUDA toolkit on the VM worker node. See the scripts folder for more details.
